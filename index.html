            Many websites choose to display a short explanatory text in a
            prominent position of their web page layouts to inform visitors what
            the purpose of the site is. This introductory text, when crafted
            well, can help users quickly decide whether they’re in the right
            place or not. A website has mere seconds to let visitors know that
            they’ve found what they’re looking for, and your site introduction
            is your brief elevator pitch.

                competitive in the market. These solutions are achieved through
                analysis of data which is collected, retrieved and re-used for
                prediction and classification purposes.As you probably often see

          <h2>Front End Web Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Web development takes into account many security considerations,
            such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output,
            and encryption. Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be
            executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge
            of Web development as a whole. Scripts can be used to exploit Web
            sites by granting unauthorized access to malicious users that try to
            collect information such as email addresses, passwords and protected
            content like credit card numbers.
